## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I relearned using flexbox without any frameworks. It had been awhile since I really needed to write any CSS without the use of Bootstrap or Material UI. It was fun rediscovering basic CSS for a change.

### Continued development

I just want to keep go back over plain CSS with out the use of frameworks to cement concepts of flexbox, grid and positioning.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me with flexbox concepts and when it is really appropriate to use it.
